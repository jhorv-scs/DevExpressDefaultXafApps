# DevExpressDefaultXafApps
This repository holds default app templates for various versions of DevExpress XAF framework applications, primarily for comparing differences between DevExpress versions.

All apps were created with the name "XafApp", then the top-level directory was renamed to the corresponding DevExpress version.

## Variants

Each general configuration of the new XAF app wizard is given a variant letter, starting with 'A'.  See the variant's README-Var-?.md file for the details of each variant.
