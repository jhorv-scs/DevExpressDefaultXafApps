# DevExpressDefaultXafApps
This repository holds default app templates for various versions of DevExpress XAF framework applications, primarily for comparing differences between DevExpress versions.

All apps were created with the name "XafApp", then the top-level directory was renamed to the corresponding DevExpress version.
